# CabEOS App
Initially the App will be built in Web-based framework with built-in native support. As this is easy, so more contributors will be interested in doing this.

> NOTE: But, the recommended framework is __Qt C++__. This is because, it will be very fast and also going to have native support for all platforms - Android, iOS, Windows.
